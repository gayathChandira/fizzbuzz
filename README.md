# FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to a user input number and for multiples of ‘3’ print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of ‘5’ print “Buzz” and then if the number is multiples of both 3 and 5 it should print "FizzBuzz". This program only allows user to enter a number between 1 and 1000 and user can only enter a number. 

This application also inclueds the option to change the theme between Light Mode and Dark Mode.
